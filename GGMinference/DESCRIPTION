Title: Inference for Undirected Gaussian Graphical Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jana Jankova [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Jana Jankova <jana.jankova@gmail.com>
Description: Confidence intervals for edges in high-dimensional undirected Gaussian 
    graphical models and p-values for testing their significance. The confidence intervals
    can be based either on the graphical lasso or the neighbourhood lasso (in the high-
    dimensional case) and on the precision matrix (in the low-dimensional case).
