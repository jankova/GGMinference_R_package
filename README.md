# GGMinference
Confidence intervals for edges in high-dimensional undirected Gaussian graphical models and p-values for testing their significance. The confidence intervals and tests are based on a de-biased version of the graphical lasso (Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (2008)) or the nodewise (neighbourhood) lasso (Meinshausen and Buehlmann (2006)). For low-dimensional case, confidence intervals can be computed using the precision matrix estimator.
